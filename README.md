# Image-Scaling-Assignment

Write a program to do the following:

1.Load an image from the disk

2.Convert the image to gray-scale (8bpp format)

3.Re-sample the image such that the size is 0.7 times it original dimensions using linear interpolation method and save the image.

4.Re-sample the image created in (step 3) back to its original size and save the image.

5.Compute the sum of the average of the squared difference between pixels in the original image (in step 2) and the re-samples image in (step 4)

6.Submit your program and all sample images, and, outputs as a single ZIP file

Please note that except for image loading and saving, you are not allowed to use any image processing libraries (such as OpenCV).  All code must be your native coding.  You may use any popular programming language for coding.
